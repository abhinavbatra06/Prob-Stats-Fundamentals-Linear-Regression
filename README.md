Question : 

(Height and Weight) The table in ANSUR II MALE Public.csv reports physical measure
ments of members of the US army. In this problem, we will work with simple linear
 regression to estimate weight (Weightlbs) as a function of height (Heightin). Let h rep
resent height (in inches) and w represent weight (in pounds).

 (a) Compute the OLS estimator of weight given height. Add this line on a scatterplot
 (with h on the x-axis; w on the y-axis) and also provide the OLS estimator in
 equation form:
 ˆ
 w = ˆ β0 + ˆ β1h
 
 (b) Compute the sample covariance between the height and the residual of the OLS
 estimator. Are they correlated?
 
 (c) Interpret the slope coefficient, ˆ β1.
 
 (d) Compute the sample variance of the weight, the OLS estimator of the weight, and
 the residual. What relationship do you find among these three values?
 
 (e) Compute and compare the sample coefficient of determination (using its definition
 as the fraction of the variance explained by the linear estimator), and compare it to
 the squared sample correlation coefficient.
 
 (f) Compute the OLS estimator of h given w. Then rearrange this formula to express
 w as a function of h.
 ˜
 w = ˜ β0 + ˜ β1h
 Add this line also on the scatterplot (in a different color), and compare it with your
 initial OLS line.
